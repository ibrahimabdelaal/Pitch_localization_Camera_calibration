Step 1: Data Preparation and Preprocessing
Dataset:

Use SoccerNet or a similar dataset with sequences of raw broadcast frames.
Extract sequences of 
ùëÅ
N frames (e.g., 3‚Äì5 consecutive frames) per sample.
Preprocessing:

Resize images to a fixed resolution (e.g., 512√ó512).
Normalize pixel values (e.g., scale to 
[
0
,
1
]
[0,1] or use ImageNet statistics).
Optionally, apply minimal edge detection if it benefits learning (e.g., a Sobel filter).
## Step 2: Patch Embedding
Candidate Architectures:

Vision Transformer (ViT):
Standard ViT from the ‚Äútimm‚Äù library can be used for patch embedding.
Swin Transformer:
Swin Transformer is effective at capturing local context and supports hierarchical representations.
DINOv2 Backbone:
Pretrained on large-scale datasets and provides robust feature representations.
Implementation:

Divide each frame into fixed-size patches (e.g., 16√ó16) and project them into an embedding space.
Incorporate positional encodings that capture spatial (and later temporal) information.
Step 3: Multi-Frame Transformer Encoder
Architecture Options:

Standard Transformer Encoder:
Use multi-head self-attention to process tokens from all frames simultaneously.
Hierarchical Transformers (e.g., Swin Transformer):
They can handle multi-scale features, which is valuable if field details vary in scale.
Temporal Fusion Mechanism:
Consider using cross-attention layers that allow tokens from different frames to interact.
Efficient Transformers:
Models like Linformer or Performer could reduce computational overhead if needed.
Implementation Tips:

Stack 6‚Äì12 transformer layers.
Use dropout and layer normalization for stability.
Fuse the multi-frame tokens; you might consider concatenating tokens along the temporal dimension and then applying a few transformer layers to aggregate the information.
Step 4: Global Feature Aggregation
Techniques:
Global Average Pooling:
Pool the transformer‚Äôs output tokens into a single global feature vector.
Learnable Aggregation Tokens:
Similar to the [CLS] token in BERT, add a learnable token that aggregates the information from all patches.
Step 5: Homography Regression Head
Architecture:
A simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) that takes the aggregated global feature vector and outputs 8 values for the homography (or directly a 3√ó3 matrix with one parameter fixed to 1).
Candidate Layers:
2‚Äì3 fully connected layers with ReLU activations.
Optionally, add batch normalization to stabilize training.
Step 6: Differentiable Warping Module
Libraries:

Kornia:
Kornia provides a differentiable warping function that can be used to apply the predicted homography to input images or keypoints.
PyTorch:
Ensure the warping module is integrated as part of the computational graph to backpropagate the loss.
Usage:

Use the predicted homography to warp a grid of keypoints or even the entire image.
Compute the reprojection loss between the warped grid and ground-truth alignment points.
Step 7: Loss Functions and Training Strategy
Loss Components:
Homography L2 Loss:
Directly penalize the difference between predicted and ground-truth homography parameters.
Reprojection Loss:
Compute the average Euclidean distance between warped keypoints and their ground-truth positions in the pitch coordinate system.
Temporal Consistency Loss (Optional):
Encourage smoothness of the predicted homography across consecutive frame sequences.
Training:
Use a multi-task loss that combines the above components.
Start training on synthetic data if necessary, then fine-tune on real SoccerNet sequences.
Leverage pretrained transformer weights (from DINOv2 or Swin) to speed up convergence.
Step 8: Evaluation
Metrics:

Evaluate the alignment using reprojection errors on key field points.
Use the GS-HOTA metric (if available) to compare game state reconstruction performance.
Measure temporal consistency of the predicted homography over sequences.
Candidate Tools:

Use existing evaluation code from SoccerNet-GSR baseline as a reference.
Visualize warped outputs to qualitatively assess alignment.
